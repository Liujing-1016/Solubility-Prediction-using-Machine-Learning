# Solubility-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A course project to estabilish a machine learning model to predict aqueous solubility of chemical compounds through hyperparameter tunings among five regression models: SVMRegressor, RandomForest, XGBoost, KNeighborRegressor and LinearRegression. 
Using the dataset extracted from the AqSolDB, We successfully built a random forest model to predict the aqueous solubility and the conformal prediction model to evaluate the accuracy of RF model at different confidence levels.
